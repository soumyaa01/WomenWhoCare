The skin that shows  

turns heads around  

but for all the wrong reasons.  

Sigh.  

So listen now and learn  

and don’t mistake it for a lesson  

for we’re way past that phase  

We now talk in threats.  

The skin that shows  

is shown and not displayed  

it will not get covered 

and it still wouldn’t be an invitation. 

The skin that shows  

is there to be seen 

and it isn’t smooth like silk 

(oh, how disappointing) 

it’s coarse, burnt, enraged 

This skin cannot be tamed. 

The skin that shows 

is a sign to you  

and of course, it is 

Warnings are signs too. 

So back off while there’s time 

The skin that shows 

is a living crime 

It’ll burn you crisp 

and embrace the blame  

for the skin is thick now;  

The skin that shows  

Will rip yours off.  

An armour, not an ornament 

The skin that shows,  

that asked for it  

all the melanin, dyed in red.  

It’s not paint.  

So dare to look at it  

Stare, like you always do.  

The skin that shows,  

the one that had it coming  

Is now coming for you.
